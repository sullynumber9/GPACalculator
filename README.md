The program will return a text file with your GPA in each class and your cGPA on the McMaster scale
The program will also return your cGPA on the 4.0 scale
It will also see if you are failing on the basis of either A. two failed classes or B. a cGPA less than 1 (average below a 50)
It will tell you what classes you failed and what you need to retake as well
